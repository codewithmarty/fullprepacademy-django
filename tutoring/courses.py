        'description': "In Grade 7 through 12 math, students progressively cover foundational to advanced concepts. Grade 7 introduces integers, fractions, ratios, and basic geometry. Grade 8 delves into linear equations, congruence, and basic trigonometry. Grade 9 expands to quadratic equations, circles, and trigonometric functions. In Grade 10, polynomials, functions, and transformations are explored. Grade 11 covers pre-calculus with exponential functions, derivatives, and statistics. Grade 12 includes calculus, advanced functions, vectors, and data analysis. This progression equips students with algebraic, geometric, and analytical skills essential for higher-level mathematics and real-world applications.",
